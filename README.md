# In-N-Out-Order-Builder
 A simple app to build your In-N-Out order without knowing the code words


# Notes
 If you are building on a non-OSX host, you will see a warning when you build:
 ```
 The following Kotlin/Native targets cannot be built on this machine and are disabled:
iosArm64, iosSimulatorArm64, iosX64
```
It's fine, don't worry about it.
